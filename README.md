This is project in Automata Theory done as a part of the Formal methods in software engineering written in python.

The project should illustrate the relationship between the regular expressions and the finite automata. Therefore we have two parts of the project.

First part is transformation of the regular expression to the minimized Deterministic Finite Automata and the second part is transformation of the Finite Automata (deterministic, non-deterministic or Îµ-nfa) to the regular expression.

As for the libraries, only standard python libraries have been used and the functionalities written above are tested using python unit-testing library 'pytest'.
